# FYProject
My final year project - An online Video Chat Application. I have built it using Nodejs and javascript with the help of WebRTC, MongoDB, HTML,CSS,JQuery and Visual Studio.

I will explain how to install and run my application. The external application you need installed on your computer are:

Windows/Linux/MacOs

NodeJS/npm enironment - The back end server 

MongoDB database - The batabase used. Before rruning my application  
you need to have setup this database and and creating a database called "Users" with a collection called "users"

Web Browser - Any except Internet Explorer


In order to run my application you have to:
1. cd into VidHealth. - goes inot the main working folder
2. run command npm intstall  - installs all the relevent dependencies 
3. npm start - the script used to run the application. it calls the "node app.js"
